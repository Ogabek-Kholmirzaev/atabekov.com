            Hey ðŸ‘‹ there,

            <br />
            I&apos;m Atabekov Farrukh, results-driven software engineer with
            expertise in designing and optimizing software systems.

          <p>
            I&apos;ve contributed to open source projects and spoken at meet-ups
            about software engineering, web and mobile development. I write

            I spend most of my time writing code and I enjoy doing so. I
            regularly solve programming challenges and try to participate on
            Hackathons. You can read more about{' '}

            The accessibility of information in today&apos;s era continues to
            astonish me, and I am committed to further expanding my knowledge

            about my story of becoming a software engineer.

          <p>
            Currently, I am a member of{' '}

            and organizations.

          <p>
            The entire point of development is to be able to create and build
            stuff that others can use and benefit from. I have been among teams
            and built some applications as a startup. In the fast paced tech
            world, I believe it is important to focus on the growth and
            usability of the application and to be constantly on the look for
            features that serve to make it a breeze for its existing and new
            users.
